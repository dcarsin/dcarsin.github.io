                <p>PHASE 1: TEMPLE OPEN FOR LIVING SEALINGS ONLYâ€”Based on First Presidency direction, this temple has
                    resumed limited operations. At this time, only husband-and-wife living sealings are being performed
                    for members who have already received their endowment. Sealings will be performed by appointment

                    will have minimal staff and the number of guests will be limited. Initially, appointments will only
                    be scheduled through August. To schedule an appointment, please send an email to the temple using
                    the link below and include the names of the couple, desired sealing date, phone numbers, and the
                    best time to contact you. All government guidelines will be observed, including regulations related
                    to travel, gatherings, sanitization, and safety. All patron housing, cafeteria, and clothing
                    services remain closed. Please check this page regularly for updates.</p>
