            <p>Modern snowboarding began in 1965 when Sherman Poppen, an engineer in Muskegon, Michigan, invented a toy
                for his daughters by fastening two skis together and attaching a rope to one end so he would have some
                control as they stood on the board and glided downhill. Dubbed the "snurfer" (combining snow and surfer)
                by his wife Nancy, the toy proved so popular among his daughters' friends that Poppen licensed the idea
                to a manufacturer, Brunswick Corporation, that sold about a million snurfers over the next decade. And,
                in 1966 alone, over half a million snurfers were sold.<br>
                In February 1968, Poppen organized the first snurfing competition at a Michigan ski resort that
                attracted enthusiasts from all over the country.
                One of those early pioneers was Tom Sims, a devotee of skateboarding (a sport born in the 1950s when
                kids attached roller skate wheels to small boards that they steered by shifting their weight). As an
                eighth grader in Haddonfield, New Jersey, in the 1960s, Sims crafted a snowboard in his school shop
                class by gluing carpet to the top of a piece of wood and attaching aluminum sheeting to the bottom.
                He produced commercial snowboards in the mid-70s.<br>
                The pioneers were not all from the United States; in 1976, Welsh skateboard enthusiasts Jon Roberts and
                Pete Matthews developed their own snowboards to
                use at their local dry ski slope. Also during this same period, in 1977, Jake Burton Carpenter, a
                Vermont native who had enjoyed snurfing since the age of 14, impressed the crowd at a Michigan snurfing
                competition with bindings he had designed to secure his feet to the board. That same year, he founded
                Burton Snowboards in Londonderry, Vermont. The "snowboards" were made of wooden planks that were
                flexible and had water ski foot traps. Very few people picked up snowboarding because the price of the
                board was considered too high at $38 and were not allowed on many ski hills, but eventually Burton would
                become the biggest snowboarding company in the business. Burton's early designs for boards with
                bindings became the dominant features in snowboarding.</p>
